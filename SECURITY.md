## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in SageMCP, please report it by emailing the maintainers directly rather than opening a public issue.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if any)

We will acknowledge your email within 48 hours and send a more detailed response within 7 days indicating the next steps in handling your report.

After the initial reply to your report, we will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and may ask for additional information.

## Disclosure Policy

When we receive a security bug report, we will:

1. Confirm the problem and determine affected versions
2. Audit code to find similar problems
3. Prepare fixes for all supported releases
4. Release patches as soon as possible

Thank you for helping keep SageMCP and its users safe!
